# ⚠️ MIGRATION NOTICE

**The Kafka Client Framework ("StreamKernel") has moved.**

This repository is now dedicated exclusively to **Algorithmic Benchmarking** and **Computer Science Fundamentals** (Big O Analysis).

### ➡️ [Click here for the new StreamKernel Repository](https://github.com/IntuitiveDesigns/StreamKernel)

If you are looking for the High-Performance Kafka Source/Sink Framework, DLQ patterns, or SPI implementation, please update your bookmarks and stars to the new location.

## A Modern Java 21 Data Structures & Algorithms Benchmarking Framework

> "Theory tells you O(N log N) is fast. The Arena shows you how fast."

## 🚀 Overview

Algorithm Arena modernizes classic CS concepts using Java 21 features such as Records, Pattern Matching, Sealed Classes, and Virtual Threads.

At its core is a **Polymorphic Benchmarking Arena** that compares algorithms in real time, validating theoretical Big‑O performance against real execution behavior.

---

## 🌟 Unique Features

### 1. Self‑Validating Complexity Contracts (`BigOAnalysis`)
Every algorithm declares its **time and space complexity** before compiling, ensuring transparency and consistency.

---

### 2. Sorting Arena (`SortingComparison`)
Benchmark 15+ sorting algorithms under controlled conditions.

**Includes:**
- Identical randomized datasets  
- Microsecond timers  
- Recursive overflow protection  
- Automatic sorting verification  

---

# 🏁 Final Notes
Algorithm Arena is a blend of:

- Algorithm benchmarking
- Modern Java 21 exploration
