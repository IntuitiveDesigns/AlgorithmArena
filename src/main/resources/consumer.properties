# FETCHING STRATEGY
# "Don't send me data until you have at least 1MB accumulated."
# This drastically reduces network chatter during replay.
fetch.min.bytes=1048576

# Wait up to 500ms for that 1MB to accumulate.
fetch.max.wait.ms=500

# Allow the consumer to pull a massive chunk (50MB) per partition per request.
# Essential for utilizing NVMe read speeds.
max.partition.fetch.bytes=52428800

# SOCKET BUFFERS (Client Side)
# Ensure the client's network buffer is large enough for the massive fetches
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=1048576

# MANUAL OFFSET CONTROL
# Disable auto-commit. You need manual control to ensure
# state is fully rebuilt before marking an offset as "processed."
enable.auto.commit=false

# IDENTIFICATION (Optional but good practice)
